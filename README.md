# sell-house-price
Predict prices of houses to sell using Linear Regression with Multiple variables or Multivariate Linear Regression.

# Dataset
The file `data2.txt` contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (*in square feet*), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.

This exercise is from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This Assignment is originally written in MATLAB, but in this repository I converted it to Python.

This model can only predict price of the houses in Portland, Oregon. Predicting prices from other place needs to change the dataset.
